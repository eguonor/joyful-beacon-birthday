              I truly believe that God brought you into my life for a reason. When I faced the uncertainty of my temporary residential permit, you stood by me in ways I can never fully express. Your support was not just financial, but also emotional and mental, and it made all the difference. I am where I am today because of you, and I'm endlessly grateful for your kindness and your unwavering belief in me.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
              Joy, you have been a beacon of light in my life. When I was struggling with my residency issues, your support went beyond what I could have asked for. You taught me the true meaning of friendship, and your generosity and wisdom have helped shape my path. I can honestly say that a significant part of my growth and success is thanks to you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
              Joy, your energy and kindness deserve a day just as special as you are. Here's to a year of joy, growth, and all the good things you've been dreaming of.
            </p>
